Default right Sidebar

To create your own sidebar:

- Create a new **right_sidebar.md" file in /content/sidebar/.
- Add frontmatter if desired:

```text
+++
title = "Default Right"
+++  
```

- Add any content below that using markdown.

This is more advanced, but the sidebars are generated as a standard Hugo page, so you can replace the .md with .html and be fancy with [Hugo templating](https://gohugo.io/templates/) as well.
