# sadGrl theme for Hugo

## This is the default home page.

To create your own hope page, make a new file called "_index.md" in the **/content** folder of your page. (*Not in the themes folder!*)

You can also just copy /themes/hugo-sadGrl/content/_index.md into /content, and edit that.

(*In Hugo, when a file with the same name exists in both /content and in the theme/content folder, the /content copy is the overriding one.*)

At the top of this new file, you can configure ["frontmatter"](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/).
This theme uses the following frontmatter. Each of them can be deleted per your preference on each page.

```text
+++
title = "The title of the page will be over the heading image."
subtitle = "The subtitle will be below the title."
heading = "Heading for the top content on the site."
subheading = "Subheading for the top content on the site."
+++
```

Below the frontmatter, you can write whatever you want, using ["markdown"](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) formatting. Some example text is below.

You can change most of the theme's colors and the layouts by editing the **hugo.toml** configuration file, which you would have already copied from theme.toml in order to get this far.

Mutiny lee chase guns schooner bowsprit. Hogshead galleon lookout mutiny bilge water. Gunwalls gun Jolly Roger scuttle dance the hempen jig.

Clipper rum Shiver me timbers shrouds hornswaggle. Cat o'nine tails shrouds Spanish Main haul wind Nelsons folly. Loaded to the gunwalls grapple barkadeer bounty cackle fruit. Yard reef sails heave down coxswain bilge rat. Topmast port brig boom cutlass.
