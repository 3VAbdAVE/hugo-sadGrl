<h1 align="center">sadGrl for Hugo</h1>

<h4 align="center">A Hugo theme for building simple retro websites.</h4>

> sadGrl is a simple theme built out of code generated by *[sadGrl's layout builder](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/)*
>
> The layout builder was created as a jumpstart tool for people to create static sites hosted places like Neocities or Github and ideally learn some HTML and/or CSS in the process.
> 
> The goal of this theme is to replicate the functionality of that tool using Hugo, while offering more variations to people who just want to publish a site.
> 
> I hope it can also serve as a jumpstart for people learning about Hugo and/or static generator tools.

![sadGrl full layout](screenshots/fullcontent.png)

The default site is built to resemble the layout builder as closeley as possible, including the pink/purple themes and starry background.
However, this is all configurable.

I couldn't find any simple Hugo themes that weren't loaded with interactive tools and javascript frameworks in slick modern interfaces. I don't want to maintain a database, plugins, tools, javascript, comments, blogs, etc. Just make the HTML go to a site like we did in the 90's, except pushed from an automatable workflow. *\</old man yells at cloud...\>*

## Features

This recreates the functionaliy of the sadGrl layout builder via hugo.toml settings.

- Topbar on/off
- Navigation bar on/off
- Left and right sidebars separately on/off
- Footer on/off
- Spacing between elements is configurable vs. on/off.
- Banner image height configurable

This theme offers additional optional functionality unavailable in the layout builder, which hard-codes a lot of this in the output. No need to change CSS or HTML directly.

- Background image and/or color
- Per-page banner image vs. one global image
- Title and subtitle floated over the banner image
- Font selection for content, page titles and subtitles
- Most element colors
- Content/Sidebar width
- Update content on the home page

## Installation

This theme is designed to be as easy as Hugo can get.

If you've never used Hugo, there's tons of [Hugo tutorials](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) out there, and most are terrible if you just want to make a website. Follow whichever you'd like to install Hugo, create your site, and get this theme installed.

Once you've got a folder that looks like **/your_website_folder/themes/hugo-sadGrl**, you'll want to copy  **/your_website_folder/themes/hugo-sadGrl/theme.toml** to **/your_website_folder/hugo.toml** The name changes from theme.toml to hugo.toml. (This is to help ensure you keep an original copy of theme.toml.)

At this point, you can cd into **/your_website_folder** and run **hugo server**.

If that starts without errors, open a browser to localhost:1313, and you should see the site.

![Default Site](screenshots/theme-default-config.png)

All layout features are enabled by default. The layout is easily customized.
The default templates also include some instruction text to help get accustomed to Hugo and how this theme works.

When you're ready, you'll want to copy the contents of **/public/** to the root of your web host.

Small tip for keeping your site clean:

- Before copying your site up, first *delete* the public folder, and re-run hugo build. Hugo fingerprints .css and some other files. So every change will create a new main.XXX.css in /public/ that you don't need to upload.
- After copying your site up, *delete* the older /css/main.XXX.css files on your hosting server. They probably don't really hurt anything, but they take space and aren't needed.

## Configuration

See theme.toml. Most of the general styles can be changed. If you want custom fonts, pop them into your site's static/fonts, and then create CSS blocks to define them.
