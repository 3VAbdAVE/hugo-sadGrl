# sadGrl

## Based on code generated from *[sadGrl's layout builder](https://goblin-heart.net/sadgrl/projects/layout-builder/)*

I just wanted a theme that I could use to create a static, old-timey website. I don't want a blog, I don't expect to update often, just fire and forget with the feel of an old timey 90's website.

## Features

This does what a default Hugo template does. Styling is based on the sadGrl layout source. The options in the layout builder are available through the configuration.

## Installation

Copy/Paste it into your themes folder, or else do the fancy githum module tricks.

## Configuration

See theme.toml. Most of the general styles can be changed. If you want custom fonts, pop them into your site's static/fonts, and then create CSS blocks to define them.
